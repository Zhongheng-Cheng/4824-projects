1.  Is our multiplier fully-pipelined? Can it accept one input on each
    cycle and compute the outputs concurrently in separate cycles?
    Explain in a sentence or two.



2.  For the 8-stage multiplier, what are the minimum clock period
    and overall time for a multiplication?

Clock period: x.x ns
Overall time: x.x ns

3.  For 4-stage?

Clock period: x.x ns
Overall time: x.x ns

4.  For 2-stage?

Clock period: x.x ns
Overall time: x.x ns

5.  What patterns in the clock period and overall time do you see as we
    decrease the number of stages? Why would you expect this pattern?



6.  What is the minimum clock period for your ISR module (with the 8-stage mult)?

Clock period: x.x ns

7.  How long (in ns) would it take your module to compute the square root of
    1001 given the cycle time of question 6? Would you expect a performance
    gain or penalty if you used the 2-stage multiplier?
